Enhanced History Privacy Policy
===============================

This extension does not and will not [ever] send your data externally.

If it does, then it's a bug, and not on purpose.

Data may be stored locally (duh), but in that case it is fully yours to keep.

No information about you is sent to us. That is the entire reason why this fork was created.

I hope this appeases Google.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
